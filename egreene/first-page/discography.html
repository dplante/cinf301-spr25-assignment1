            <h2>About the Band</h2>
            <p>Megadeth is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist/guitarist Dave Mustaine. Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship, Megadeth is one of the "big four" of American thrash metal along with Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer, responsible for the genre's development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationships.

                In 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the independent record label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members' substance abuse issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of platinum-selling albums, including So Far, So Good... So What! (1988), Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition. Megadeth's most recent album, The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!, was released in 2022.

            <h2>Editor's Pick</h2>
            <p>My personal pick from Megadeth's discography would have to be Rust in Peace. It's a close race for my favorite, but this album comes out on top. It combines all of the best features of Megedeth up to this point, combining aggression and technicality better than the albums before and after. The production and mixing are perfect for the sound the band is going for here, and clocking in at about 41 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. The musicianship and lyricism are top notch here, and considering the album came out in 1990, it doesn't seem like a rehashing of everything thrash had already established as a genre. Rust in Peace is a great entry point into Megadeth, and I'd highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to get into the band or metal in general.</p>
